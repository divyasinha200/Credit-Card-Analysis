## 👩‍💼 Business Analyst Role

### 🧩 Business Problem

The financial institution was facing increasing credit losses due to unpaid balances and defaults. There was no clear understanding of which customer groups (by age, gender, marital status, education) were most likely to default, or how repayment behavior varied across months. The lack of data-driven insights made it difficult to set better credit policies.

### 💡 My Role as a Business Analyst

As a Business Analyst, I:

- Identified key risk-related KPIs:
  - Monthly repayment status
  - Total bill vs total paid back
  - Default payment next month
- Segmented customers by:
  - Age (Binned)
  - Gender
  - Marital Status
  - Education level
- Designed filters to isolate:
  - Defaulters vs Non-defaulters
  - Loan & Advances
  - Repayment behavior
- Interpreted trends to support credit scoring improvements
